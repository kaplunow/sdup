### 1 - 3.3.2023 - The Sequential cordic processor for sine & cosine calculations.

### 2 - 10.3.2023 - Custom system design in FPGA laboratory

This tutorial turned out to be very problematic. I strongly suggest checking (before exporting hardware) whether you have all the files (see the picture of missing file below). Lack of it will create error on the LAST STEP OF THE TUTORIAL

This problem was solved by NOT including Verilog Synthesis and Verilog Simulation files in Repackaging-IP.
