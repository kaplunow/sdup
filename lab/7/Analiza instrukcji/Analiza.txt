- błąd na samym początku instrukcji
Aby działało trzeba podmienić na:
enum { S1 = 32'h01, S2 = 32'h02, S3 = 32'h03, S4 = 32'h04, S5 = 32'h05,
S6 = 32'h06, S7 = 32'h07, S8 = 32'h08, S9 = 32'h09, S10 = 32'h0a,
S11 = 32'h0b, S12 = 32'h0c, S13 = 32'h0d } state;

- trzeba pamietac o zmianie modulu w testbenchu

- Exercise 2 - zmiana parametrów nie powoduje niczego - ZZZ na sin_out, cos_out

Pytania i odpowiedzi

Which states have been modified in comparison to the FSMD presented in Fig. 1?

	State 2 (622 in binary -> 0.607421)
	State 6, state 7 (changed nextstate to s12),
	State 8 - State 11 - deleted
	State 12 - changed code

What is the maximum error when expressed in LSBs?

	Really depends on the simulation time - for Cordic1 it was 5 for cordic2 it was 7
	MSE and ME values also vary - usually cordic 2 has worse results

Is it possible to obtain maximum error below 1 LSB?
	CANT DO

Note the simulation time – how many clock cycles per single
calculation are required. Note the calculation errors?
	for i_max = 10, guard_bits = 0 i have read 23 clock cycles. From what i understand it should be 21 clock cycles

What, in theory, is the MSE and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when only
truncation is taken into account?
	CANT DO
	
	
	
After design implementation, open utilisation report. Note number of used
flip-flops and LUTs. Then view cordic_rtl5.sv and try to count the number of
required flip-flops, note signals with reg keyword.
	131 LUT
	83  Flip-Flop
	29 rzeczy ze słowem reg?
	
What is roughly the maximum clock frequency?
	between 222 and 250MHz


cordic6	
	139 LUT
	115 Flip flops
	max frequency is between 285.7Mhz and 300.3MHz
